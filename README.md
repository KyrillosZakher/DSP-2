# DSP-2
- The First Task is about building a GUI with python for Displaying a signal and its filteration with a convolution method
  , Generating a sound signal composed from different sinusoids, and other from mixture of sinusoids and exponentials and
  Plotting several sinusoids and exponential signals from nature, then show the sampled version of these signals.
  
- The Second Task is about building a GUI with MATLAB for displaying two pictures and getting the magnitude and phase of         fourier series of each of them and combine the magnitude of one of them with the phase of the other and displaying the         result.
The Third Task is about  Writing Python/MATLAB Wrappers for C/C++
